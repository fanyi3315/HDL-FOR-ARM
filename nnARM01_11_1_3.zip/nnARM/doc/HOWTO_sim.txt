SECTION	1	how to simulate with vcs
	if you see the "e:\ssy\nn\nn\nnARM_tb" directory? in it you can find "asm" directory, still in "asm", you can find "add64" and so on.
	each of these directory have a program in XXX.s file(assembly language). 
	and each of these directory have an "ASC" file. this is the program immage that have been convert to ASCII format.just copy this file to "e:\ssy\nn\nn\prj\wv", then start vcs and use "E:\ssy\nn\nn\nnARM\sim\vcs\tb_system.v" as the top level file to simulate
	the registers file of nnARM is in tb_system\
